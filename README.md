# E-Commerce Customer Analysis & Predictive Modeling

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Customer Analysis & Predictive Modeling** project! üöÄ This project explores customer behavior through data visualization and predictive modeling, helping us understand what drives customer spending.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Time on Website vs. Yearly Amount Spent
Unlike the app, **time on the website does not strongly correlate with spending**. This suggests improving the website may not significantly impact revenue, while the app experience holds greater potential.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Time on App vs. Yearly Amount Spent
We see a **positive correlation** between time spent on the app and yearly spending. Investing in the app experience could drive higher revenue!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Time on App vs. Length of Membership
A hexbin plot shows the density of data points. Customers who spend more time on the app are not necessarily long-term members, meaning **app engagement doesn't directly correlate with loyalty.**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pairplot - Feature Correlations
A pairplot helps us visualize relationships between different numerical variables. From this, we can see which features have strong correlations with **Yearly Amount Spent**, hinting at key predictors.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Length of Membership vs. Yearly Amount Spent
One of the strongest correlations! Customers with longer memberships tend to spend more yearly. This insight suggests **loyalty programs** could be a major driver for revenue growth.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Performance - Predicted vs. Actual
Here, we compare our model's predictions to the actual test values. A strong **diagonal alignment** confirms our model is performing well!

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Histogram of Residuals
This histogram visualizes the residuals from our linear regression model, showing how well our model fits the data. A normal distribution indicates a good model fit, whereas skewness may suggest underlying patterns the model hasn't captured.

## üî¢ Interpreting the Coefficients
- Holding all other features fixed, a **1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length** is associated with an **increase of $25.98** in total dollars spent.
- Holding all other features fixed, a **1 unit increase in Time on App** is associated with an **increase of $38.59** in total dollars spent.
- Holding all other features fixed, a **1 unit increase in Time on Website** is associated with an **increase of just $0.19** in total dollars spent.
- Holding all other features fixed, a **1 unit increase in Length of Membership** is associated with an **increase of $61.27** in total dollars spent.

## üìå Business Insights & Recommendations
üí° **Should the company focus more on the mobile app or the website?**

This is a tricky question! There are two ways to think about it:
1. **Improve the website** to catch up to the performance of the mobile app.
2. **Double down on the mobile app**, since it already drives more revenue.

The best decision depends on additional factors, such as customer feedback and engagement metrics. It may be useful to explore the relationship between **Length of Membership and Time on App vs. Time on Website** before finalizing a strategy!

## ü§ñ Key Takeaways
‚úÖ **Length of membership is the best predictor** of yearly spending.
‚úÖ **Time on the app is more important than time on the website** for increasing revenue.
‚úÖ **Our predictive model performs well**, as shown by the residual histogram and test value scatterplot.
‚úÖ **Focusing on customer loyalty programs and app engagement** could drive business growth.
